# By running the script "run Analysis" 
# the working environment will be set and the UCI HAR dataset will be downloaded and unziped. 
# Both the training and the test datasets will be combined and measurements will be extracted. 
# In the end the dataset will be "tidied" by aggrating the data by subject, activity and the measurements average per variable. 
# The tidy dataset will be printed.
